# Python Socket Server

A robust TCP socket server implementation in Python that handles HTTP requests and demonstrates fundamental concepts of network programming.

## 🚀 Features

- TCP server listening on port 8080
- HTTP request processing
- Dynamic response handling
- Proper buffer management for large data
- Clean connection handling
- UTF-8 encoding support
- Timeout management
- Error handling

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/socket-server.git
cd socket-server
```

2. Run the server:
```bash
python3 server.py
```

## 💻 Usage

The server will start listening on `localhost:8080`. You can test it using various methods:

### Using curl:
```bash
# Send a simple message
curl -X POST -d "Hello, World!" http://localhost:8080

# Send a file
curl -X POST --data-binary @test_data.txt http://localhost:8080
```

### Using netcat:
```bash
echo "Test message" | nc localhost 8080
```

## 🔍 How It Works

The server operates by:

1. Creating a TCP socket and binding it to port 8080
2. Listening for incoming connections
3. For each connection:
   - Receiving HTTP request data
   - Processing the request
   - Wrapping the received data in HTML tags
   - Sending back a proper HTTP response
   - Closing the connection cleanly

### Code Structure

- `receive_http_request()`: Handles receiving data with proper buffering
- `parse_http_request()`: Extracts and cleans request data
- `create_http_response()`: Generates HTTP response with HTML content
- `handle_client_connection()`: Manages individual client connections
- `main()`: Sets up and runs the server

## 🛠 Technical Details

- **Buffer Management**: Uses dynamic buffering to handle requests of any size
- **Connection Handling**: Implements proper connection cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and handling
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging connections
- **HTTP Compliance**: Proper HTTP headers and response formatting

## 🚀 Potential Applications

1. **API Debugging**
   - Inspect incoming requests
   - Test API integrations
   - Monitor payload data

2. **Network Testing**
   - Test network connectivity
   - Verify data transmission
   - Debug protocol issues

3. **Educational Tool**
   - Learn about TCP/IP
   - Understand HTTP protocol
   - Study network programming

4. **Development Tool**
   - Mock server for testing
   - Request inspection
   - Protocol verification

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- [ ] WebSocket support
- [ ] Multi-client handling with threading
- [ ] Web interface for monitoring
- [ ] Advanced logging system
- [ ] Request/Response storage
- [ ] Authentication mechanism
- [ ] HTTPS support
